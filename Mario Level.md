# Mario Level

The theme of my level is that an Monty Mole running a diamond mining operation underground and you need to stop him. Navigate through the dangerous caverns filled with mining tools, turrets, skeltons of disturbed spirits and Monty employees. However, if the player is skilled enough, they may miss their opprotunity to stop the evil Monty Mining Corp. It emphasizes the fact that struggling can lead people to greatness.

Notes after game test:

Hard jump to skip lower level is not so hard, one big choke point, add more moles, put ? block in front.
