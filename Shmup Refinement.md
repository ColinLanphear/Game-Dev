# Shmup Refinement

Which of Fullerton's Formal Elements are you working with?

What kinds of puzzles or player challenges might you include?

What are the basic rules for your game?

Power ups after beating level.

The formal elements I'm working with are objective and procedure. The objective I am using is escape. The player is meant to survive and escape the level. The procedure that I am using is a special action after each level where the player has an option to improve their ship in different ways. 

Some challanges included are bosses every 5 levels and enemies that have to be defeated in a specific order. There aren't any puzzles.

The basic rules are moving left and right, shooting, enemies taking one shot to kill (except bosses), you have 3 hit points.
