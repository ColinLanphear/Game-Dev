# Shmup Refinement

Which of Fullerton's Formal Elements are you working with?

What kinds of puzzles or player challenges might you include?

What are the basic rules for your game?

#### Power ups after beating level.

- The formal elements I'm working with are objective and procedure. The objective I am using is escape. The player is meant to survive and escape the level. The procedure that I am using is a special action after each level where the player has an option to improve their ship in different ways. 

- Some challanges included are bosses every 5 levels and enemies that have to be defeated in a specific order. There aren't any puzzles.

- The basic rules are moving left and right, shooting, enemies taking one shot to kill (except bosses), you have 3 hit points.

#### Asteroid battle royale.

- The formal elements I am working with are players and objective. The players is a free for all consisting of 10+ players. The objective is outwitting and being the last one alive. 

- Some of the challanges are the challange that other players create and there are asteroids that act as cover and extra projectiles.  

- Move all degrees with drifting (zero gravity), shooting, 5 hits to kill anyone.

#### Limited resource shmup.

- The formal elements I am working with are resources and conflict. The resources are limited and need to be managed by the player. I break the resources down to fuel, bullets and shield. This leads into the conflict. The conflict is to make the player think about when to destroy enemies and when to dodge the enemies. 

- Some challenges are the enemies engagement patterns may be able to be dodged or have to be destroyed. There will be hidden side areas that have caches of ammo, shield and fuel that would have to be solved with puzzles. I.e. shoot things in a specific order, moving items around to make a shape.

- Move forward, back, left, right, dodging, shooting, use shield, different damage needed for different enemies, collision with objects.
