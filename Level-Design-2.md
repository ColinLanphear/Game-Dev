# Level Design 2

My goal is to teach people about drybones and the black shell turtle. For drybones I wanted to show the player that drybones comes back after being bounced on. To do this, I made it so the player will jump on drybones, go to get the ? block and have coins to have them wait long enough to see drybones comes back. For the black shell turtle, I wanted to show what they do first, and the danger of them becoming a bouncy projectile, I then wanted to show they are immune to fire by putting a fire flower above a "helpless" turtle to intice them to try and kill it with fire.
